What business do you have in these lands, traveller?
If you want some of my mighty blades, you'll have to prove yourself first!
Huh? What? I don't deal with strangers!
Come back when you have a name in these lands.
You want those shiny axes, eh? Well, you ought to do some deeds to earn 'em!
I forge the mightiest tools, weapons and armour in these red halls! But not for you... at least not yet.
By my beard, the day has come when a stranger thinks he can simply buy something from me!
One does not simply trade with a stranger.
I don't trade with odd folk such as you.
Who are you?
If you wish to trade with me, you must prove yourself to the folk of these lands.
I only forge for the mightiest of the mightiest.
You are not worthy of my mighty blades.
You're not fit enough to carry Dwarven plates.
You may only trade with me when you prove yourself to the Lord of these lands.
