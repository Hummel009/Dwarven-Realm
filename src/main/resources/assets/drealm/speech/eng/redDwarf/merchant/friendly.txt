As you can see, #, my feet ache from this heavy load. Care you to buy something?
We Dwarves do not usually trade with Men, but you are an exception, #.
Ale, armour, weapons - you want it, it's yours, my friend! As long as you have enough coins...
I come from the mighty strongholds of the Red Mountains, #. No other Dwarves boast riches quite like ours.
I am travelling the land in search of wealth - perhaps you are doing the same, #?
Give me some coins, #, and I shall be a very happy merchant indeed!
Greetings, #! Do you wish to buy some goods from me?
I bring great treasures from the Red Mountains! You can have them... for a certain price!
Do you wish to trade with me, #? I have several items which might be of interest to you.
I will sell you anything for a fair price!
Do you want to trade with me, #? For a few dozen silver coins you can enjoy the craftwork of the Dwarves of Orocarni!
