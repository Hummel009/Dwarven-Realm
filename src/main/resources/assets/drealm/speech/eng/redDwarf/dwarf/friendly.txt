Roaring fires! Malt beer! Ripe meat off the bone!
You are not one of the Khaz√¢d, #, but you seem friendly enough.
Let us drink together!

Dwarven ale is the finest drink in all Middle-earth!
The wealth of the Dwarves is surpassed by no other race.
There is some good stonework here.

The smith-skill of the Dwarves is unmatched!
Do you have news from our folk in the West?
By my beard, I've not seen a Man in all my life! Welcome to my home, #!
