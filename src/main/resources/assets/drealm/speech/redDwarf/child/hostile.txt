I don't like you. Go away!
You're a bad person, #.
Raaaarrrrggghhh!
If I had an axe, I'd split your skull in two!
The Dwarves of old did not flee from enemies, and nor shall I!
You had better run before my father comes back with his axe!
Leave or face the wrath of my kin!
We Dwarves know how to handle Orc-scum such as you!
You should leave our lands! We Dwarves do not welcome evil-doers such as you!
Filthy Orc! Crawl back to your hole or face the fury of my father!
