Welcome to the Red Mountains, #!
You're not a Blacklock, or a Stonefoot...
Greetings!
One day I'll be able to drink Dwarven ale. I can't wait!
Even my mother's beard is better than yours, #!
Can you pass me some Dwarven ale while nobody's looking?
How are you, #?
Raarrrgghh!
They say I'm too young to hunt Orcs! Ha!
I wish I could wear my father's armour...
I will have a great beard one day!
There is no weapon finer than a Dwarven axe, #!
One day I shall fight the evil Orcs with my brothers!
