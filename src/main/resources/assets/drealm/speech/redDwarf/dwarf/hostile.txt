Don't expect to get the better of me, you rowdy lad!
You are no match for the kinsmen of the Red Mountains!
You should not have come here, #!
I'll cleave your miserable skull in twain!
Come on, lad! Show me what you've got!
Suffer the wrath of the Dwarves, #!
Came you here only to be crushed?
Out with you, Morgul-scum!
Draw your last breath, #!
No Dwarven ale for you!
Raaarrrgh!
I'll crush you like a rock, lad!
You have underestimated us, #!
You're a nasty piece of work, #!
What were you thinking, picking a fight with me? Ha!
Woe and ruin upon you and your kin, #!
Khazâd ai-mênu!
Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!
May you die in dragon-fire!
How dare you enter our lands?
Begone, Orc-scum!
You will pay for trespassing here, Morgul-scum!
