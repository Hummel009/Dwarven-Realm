Come in, my good fellow! I have some fine Dwarven craftwork ready for sale!
You won't find goods such as these in all of Rhun! Nor Dorwinion, for that matter...
What can I forge for you? An axe? A chestplate? I can do anything!
The smith-skill of the Dwarves is unmatched!
What can I get you?
One, two, and three! There go the ingots!
My hammer and hands may be old, but I get the job done!
My skill is matched by no other Dwarf!
Swords? Axes? Hammers? You've come to the right place!
Pay me, and you will find in your hand the mightiest smith-work in all of Middle-earth!
By my beard, what kind of armour are you wearing? Let me get you some proper plates.
Come in! Come in! I just finished cooling this fine blade!
Do you want a fine blade? I can offer you one for a cheap price!
Any wish you have in mind I can turn into forged steel!
I forge the mightiest blades and the toughest armour!
